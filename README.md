I ended up having four days and a bad idea and this is what I came up with. Its a very simple app that pulls definitions for a word provided by the user from the urbarn-dictionary api. It works like a charm, but I didn't realize how vile and disgusting the definitions on urban-dicionary are until it was too late to start an other idea. I actively discourage anyone from actually using this app for that reason.

## User Stories

-  As a user, I want to be able to sign in and see my dictionary
- As a developer, I will use nested routes and specific controller actions to create user-owned data
1.  As a user, I want to be able to find definitions from urban-dictioanry.com
1.  As a developer, I will query a third party api and provide 1-3 definitions for the user to choose from
1.  As a user, I want to be able to edit or delete definitions after I add them
1.  As a developer, I will implement CRUD functionality to allow the user to edit and delete words in their dictionary
